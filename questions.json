    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "When following the segregation of duties principle, organizations divide critical tasks into discrete components and ensure that no one individual has the ability to perform both actions. This prevents a single rogue individual from performing that task in an unauthorized manner. Mandatory vacations and job rotations are designed to detect fraud, not prevent it. Defense in depth is not a relevant principle here because the answer is seeking an initial control. Management may choose to add additional controls at a later date, but the primary objective here would be to implement segregation of duties."

This approach provides security in the event of a single control failure.

Separation of duties requires that one person not have permission to perform two separate actions that, when combined, carry out a sensitive function.

Once that's completed, the media can be reused, although it may be possible to retrieve some of the original data using retrieval tools. Erasing is the deletion of files or media and may not include all of the data on the device or media, making it the worst choice here.

This is a form of data remanence and is a concern for organizations that do not want data to potentially be accessible. Many wiping utilities deal only with currently addressable space on the drive. SSDs cannot be degaussed, and wear leveling space cannot be reliably used to hide data. These spaces are still addressable by the drive, although they may not be seen by the operating system."

    "explanation": "This is an example of an end-of-support (EOS) scenario. The company is intentionally ending support and needs to address what happens to the devices next—secure disposal, destruction, or re-sale—depending on data security requirements and policies set by the company. EOL is when a device or software is no longer made or supported, in contrast to end of support, which may be when it is no longer serviced, including via patches, upgrades, or organizational maintenance. Planned obsolescence and device risk management are not terms that are used on the exam."

    "explanation": "Downgrading systems and media is rare due to the difficulty of ensuring that sanitization is complete. The need to completely wipe (or destroy) the media that systems use means that the cost of reuse is often significant and may exceed the cost of purchasing a new system or media. The goal of purging is to ensure that no data remains, so commingling data should not be a concern, nor should the exposure of the data; only staff with the proper clearance should handle the systems!

This helps to prevent mistakes that might leave sensitive data unlabeled. Prelabeled media is not necessarily cheaper (nor may it make sense to buy!), while reusing public media simply means that it must be classified based on the data it now contains.

      "A. Ensure that the tapes are handled the same way the original media",
      "B. Increase the classification level of the tapes because they are leaving",

      "D. Decrypt the tapes in case they are lost in transit."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tapes may be vulnerable to theft or loss in transit. That means tapes that are leaving their normal storage facility should be handled according to the organization's classification schemes and handling requirements. Purging the tapes would cause the loss of data, while increasing the classification level of the tapes does not align with the standard practices for data classification and handling. The tapes should be encrypted rather than decrypted."

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the tape that is being shipped to a storage facility. You might think that the tape in shipment is “in motion,” but the concept is that the data is not being accessed and is instead in storage rather than being sent across a network. Data in a TCP packet, in an e- commerce transaction, or in local RAM is in motion and is actively being used."

    "explanation": "When the value of data changes due to legal, compliance, or business reasons, reviewing classifications and reclassifying the data is an appropriate response. Once the review is complete, data can be reclassified and handled according to its classification level. Simply relabeling the data avoids the classification process and may not result in the data being handled appropriately. Similarly, selecting a new baseline or simply encrypting the data may not handle all of the needs that the changes affecting the data create. 98. A, B, C.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Public data is just that—information that can be made public without any harm to the organization, and in fact, it is often information that the organization wants to make available. Private information should stay private inside of an organization, sensitive data may cause damage to the mission of the organization if exposed, and proprietary or confidential information is the most sensitive data that an organization wants to protect. 100. The data elements match with the categories as follows: Data elements 1. Medical records: B. PHI 2. Trade secrets A. Proprietary data 3. Social Security numbers: C. PII 4. Driver's license numbers: C. PII Medical records are an example of protected health information (PHI). Trade secrets are an example of proprietary data. Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers are examples of PII; if they were used in a medical context, they may also be PHI, but this question does not ask you to consider them in that context."

A CASB can provide insight into what users are doing, enforce policies, provide threat protection, and even provide data loss prevention capabilities. An SIEM collects logs and event information as part of security monitoring and event management.

In this situation, an employee auditing their own work would create a conflict of interest, so Lana has implemented a segregation of duties.

For example, they might use high-voltage electricity, high or low temperature, or other factors to cause a malfunction that undermines the security of the device. Side-channel attacks seek to use information about system activity and retrieve information that is actively being encrypted. Brute-force attacks attempt every possible valid combination for a key or password. In a timing attack, the attacker measures precisely how long cryptographic operations take to complete, gaining information about the cryptographic process that may be used to undermine its security. 100.

      "C. Serial data cannot be carried in TCP packets.",
      "D. TCP/IP's throughput can allow for easy denial-of-service attacks"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Multilayer protocols like Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) allow SCADA and other systems to use TCP/IP-based networks to communicate. Many SCADA devices were never designed to be exposed to a network, and adding them to a potentially insecure network can create significant risks. TLS or other encryption can be used on TCP packets, meaning that even serial data can be protected. Serial data can be carried via TCP packets because TCP packets don't care about their content; it is simply another payload. Finally, TCP/IP does not have a specific throughput as designed, so issues with throughput are device- level issues."

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "WPA3's simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) mode improves on WPA2's pre-shared key (PSK) mode by allowing for secure authentication between clients and the wireless network without enterprise user accounts. If Ben needed to worry about support for WPA3, which may not be available to all systems that may want to connect, he might have to choose WPA2. A captive portal is often used with open guest networks but requires additional work to maintain, and Enterprise mode requires user accounts."

While using two factors is more secure than a single factor, SMS is one of the less secure ways to implement two-factor authentication because of this. SMS messages can be spoofed, can be received by more than one phone, and are typically stored on the recipient's phone. The primary threat here, however, is the unencrypted message itself."

It is unlikely that traffic will be routed improperly, leading to the exposure of sensitive data, as traffic headed to internal systems and networks is unlikely to be routed to the external network. Reflected DDoS attacks are used to hide identities rather than to connect through to an internal network, and security administrators of managed systems should be able to determine both the local and wireless IP addresses his system uses."

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Cut-through switching forwards packets as soon as the destination address is known without waiting for the rest of the frame to arrive. This means that packets are not checked for integrity before being forwarded, optimizing throughput and reducing latency at the expense of error checking. Store-and-forward waits for the entire frame to allow it to be checked using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) before forwarding it. Blind and forward switching were made up for this question."

This decreases broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups that don't need to be able to access each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!"

    "explanation": "A VPN that allows access to secured VLANs is the most common security design for this type of infrastructure. This allows secured remote access while protecting IoT devices that are often unable to be properly secured and thus cannot be trusted on a more exposed network. IPS does not provide remote access, and private IP addresses alone do not provide a protected network. DLP is used to prevent data exfiltration and won't stop other attacks or provide remote management access. iSCSI is a storage protocol, not a security solution. A VPN and jump boxes are useful, but the devices would not be provided with additional security by iSCSi."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "TLS provides message confidentiality and integrity, which can prevent eavesdropping. When paired with digital signatures, which provide integrity and authentication, forged assertions can also be defeated.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Integration with cloud-based third parties that rely on local authentication can fail if the local organization's Internet connectivity or servers are offline. Adopting a hybrid cloud and local authentication system can ensure that Internet or server outages are handled, allowing authentication to work regardless of where the user is or if their home organization is online. Using encrypted and signed communication does not address availability, redirects are a configuration issue with the third party, and a local gateway won't handle remote users. Also, host files don't help with availability issues with services other than DNS."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "While many solutions are technical, if a trusted third party redirects to an unexpected authentication site, awareness is often the best defense. Using TLS would keep the transaction confidential but would not prevent the redirect. Handling redirects locally works only for locally hosted sites, and using a third-party service requires off-site redirects. An IPS might detect an attacker's redirect, but tracking the multitude of load-balanced servers most large providers use can be challenging, if not impossible. In addition, an IPS relies on visibility into the traffic, and SAML integrations should be encrypted for security, which would require a man-in-the-middle type of IPS to be configured."

Since they can quickly compare known hashes against those in a file, using rainbow tables is the fastest way to quickly determine passwords from hashes. A brute-force attack may eventually succeed but will be very slow against most hashes. Pass-the- hash attacks rely on sniffed or otherwise acquired NTLM or LanMan hashes being sent to a system to avoid the need to know a user's password. Salts are data added to a hash to avoid the use of tools like rainbow tables. A salt added to a password means the hash won't match a rainbow table generated without the same salt."

It also means that account management is simpler since multiple accounts don't have to be maintained for users who need to access systems and resources across the federation. Productivity can increase because staff don't have to remember multiple logins and can use SSO to log in once instead of multiple times.

    "explanation": "Fuzzers are tools designed to provide invalid or unexpected input to applications, testing for vulnerabilities like format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflow issues, and other problems. A static analysis relies on examining code without running the application or code and thus would not fill forms as part of a web application. Brute-force tools attempt to bypass security by trying every possible combination for passwords or other values. A black box is a type of penetration test where the testers do not know anything about the environment."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In most organizations, senior management needs to approve penetration tests because of the risk to the organization and the potential impact of the test. In a small number of organizations, the service owner may be able to make this decision, but penetration tests often have broader impacts than a single service, meaning that senior management is the proper path. Change advisory boards approve changes, not penetration tests, and system administrators may be advised of the test but do not have the authority in most organizations to sign off on a penetration test."

    "explanation": "Key risk indicators are used to tell those in charge of risk management how risky an activity is and how much impact changes are having on that risk profile. Identifying and monitoring key risk indicators can help track high-risk areas earlier in their life cycle. Yearly risk assessments may be a good idea but provide only a point-in-time view, whereas penetration tests may miss out on risks that are not directly security-related.

Social engineering does not test the ability of sites to handle load, and penetration testers may conduct denial-of-service attacks but typically do not.

In case a system is affected by cryptographic malware, it's important to have reliable backups that are not encrypted by the malware. This requires keeping your backup systems separate from your main systems and potentially implementing version control so that your unencrypted backups are not overwritten by encrypted ones that become inaccessible.

This type of agreement ensures that the cloud provider has sufficient resources to meet the needs of their clients, even in the event of multiple simultaneous disasters. It directly tackles the issue of resource allocation and availability, which is Chas's primary concern. In contrast, a nondisclosure agreement is more about confidentiality and doesn't address resource capacity.

A computer security incident is an incident that is the result of an attack or the result of malicious or intentional actions on the part of users. The unauthorized vulnerability scan of a server does violate security policy and may negatively affect the security of that system, so it qualifies as a security incident. The failure of a backup to complete properly jeopardizes availability and is, therefore, an incident, but not a computer security incident. The logging of system access and update of antivirus signatures are all routine actions that do not violate policy or jeopardize security, so they are all events rather than incidents."

In the context of digital forensics, this principle implies that there is always some form of digital trace or residue left behind when devices interact or when data is transferred. Kerckhoff's principle states that a system's security should not depend on the secrecy of its algorithm but rather on the secrecy of its keys. The principle of least privilege is a security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access—or permissions—needed to perform his job functions. Lastly, the defense-in-depth principle is a layered security approach that establishes multiple levels of defense to protect information. While these other three principles are important in cybersecurity, they do not directly relate to the collection and analysis of digital trace evidence like Locard's principle does."

More specifically, Ann's organization is likely experiencing a DNS amplification attack where an attacker sends false requests to third-party DNS servers with a forged source IP address belonging to the targeted system. Because the attack uses UDP requests, there is no three-way handshake. The attack packets are carefully crafted to elicit a lengthy response from a short query.

    "explanation": "NetFlow data contains information on the source, destination, and size of all network communications and is routinely saved as a matter of normal activity. Packet capture data would provide relevant information, but it must be captured during the suspicious activity and cannot be re- created after the fact unless the organization is already conducting 100% packet capture, which is rare.

Some tools like FireSheep have been specifically designed to capture sessions from popular websites. Fortunately, many websites now use TLS by default, but other sites still send user session information in the clear.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a U.S. law governing the healthcare sector that does provide for criminal penalties. The Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) Act governs publicly traded corporations and also provides for criminal penalties. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a U.S. law governing educational records, but it does not provide for criminal penalties. PCI DSS, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is an industry standard for payment card operations and handling. Because it is not a law, PCI DSS violations cannot incur criminal sanctions."

It is infeasible for a single person to review every single record. In an organization of 50,000 users with a 24% annual turnover, it is likely that at least 1,000 of those records have changed in the last month. This is still too many records to review.

Transport encryption would, therefore, be the most appropriate control, as anyone intercepting the information would be unable to read its contents. Storage encryption would protect against the theft of information at rest, rather than in transit over a network. Classification and labeling would not protect against interception. Data loss prevention technology may block the transfer entirely and would not meet the business requirement if it blocked the transmission and would not meet the security requirement if it did not detect the data transfer. 54.

This measure is sometimes also called maximum tolerable outage (MTO) or maximum allowable downtime (MAD). The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are related but distinct measures. The RPO focuses on data loss, indicating the maximum period in which data might be lost due to a disruption, and is used to establish the frequency of backups. The RTO, meanwhile, is the target time set for the recovery of IT and business activities after a disruption, aimed to be within the MTD but is not itself a measure of the direct impact on the business operation.

In this case, replay attacks are a more specific type of masquerading attack that relies on captured authentication tokens, and this is, therefore, a better answer.

If Alex had set up accounts for his new hire on the systems he manages, he would have been using discretionary account provisioning. If the provisioning system allowed the new hire to sign up for an account on their own, they would have used self-service account provisioning, and if there was a central, software-driven process, rather than HR forms, it would have been automated account provisioning."

That means that the most likely threats that they will face are denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and attacks against the host operating system. Malware and Trojans are less likely to be effective against a server or embedded system that doesn't browse the Internet or exchange data files; buffer overflows are usually aimed at specific applications or services."

    "explanation": "The blacklist approach to application control blocks certain prohibited packages but allows the installation of other software on systems. The whitelist approach uses the reverse philosophy and allows only approved software. It is worth noting that the terms blacklist and whitelist are increasingly deprecated and that you may encounter terms like block list or deny list and allow list as language and terminology shifts. As you prepare for the exam and your professional work, make sure to consider these equivalents. Antivirus software would only detect the installation of malicious software after the fact. Heuristic detection is a variant of antivirus software."

The courts have applied the hearsay rule to include the concept that attorneys may not introduce logs into evidence unless they are authenticated by the system administrator. In this scenario, George might also be able to provide a sworn affidavit, but the question doesn't include that option. The best evidence rule states that copies of documents may not be submitted into evidence if the originals are available.

Encrypting media can help, but without the labels, files may be stored on inappropriate media. A clear desk policy can help if casual media theft is an issue but is not likely to be an important control in this scenario.

This results in software that has had far more review than some closed-source or commercial packages (although large organizations may perform more review). The ability to change the code can sometimes be important as well, but changing open-source code in-house can create maintenance issues in the future.

This is similar to the concept of VLANs on a layer 2 switch but operating at layer 3. Routing instances operate independently, allowing IP addresses to overlap without conflict, supporting segmentation and thus permitting flexibility for zero trust implementations and other security solutions. VRF can be used to support VPCs, but that is not its only use. It is not like a VPN, and while it can be used with multilayer protocols, that isn't a primary purpose."

    "explanation": "Systems that respond to pings will show the time to live for packets that reach them. Since TTL is decremented at each hop, this can help build a rough network topology map. In addition, some firewalls respond differently to pings than a normal system, which means pinging a network can sometimes reveal the presence of firewalls that would otherwise be invisible. Hostnames are revealed by a DNS lookup, and ICMP types allowed through a firewall are not revealed by only performing a ping.

A public cloud is where the services are delivered over the public Internet and shared across different organizations. A dedicated cloud, also known as a private cloud, is operated solely for one organization, and this is not the case for Kayla's company. A private cloud is infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally, which also does not apply here.

Separation of duties is a slightly different principle, where one individual is prevented from holding the privileges to perform two separate actions that, when combined, would result in excessive permissions. Least privilege says that an individual should have the minimum necessary set of permissions to carry out their job functions. There is no indication that least privilege is violated in this scenario. Multifactor authentication is an important security control, but the scenario does not mention whether the administrators use multifactor authentication to perform these activities."

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "OAuth is used to provide secure delegated access in scenarios exactly like this. OpenID is used to sign in using credentials from an identity provider to other services, such as when you log in with Google to other sites. SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, is used to make security assertions allowing authentication and authorizations between identity providers and service providers. Kerberos is mostly used inside of organizations instead of for federation, as this question focuses on. OAuth is specifically designed to provide secure delegated access, allowing Amanda's application to access users' Gmail contacts without requiring users to share their Gmail credentials. It is widely used by cloud services for this purpose. In contrast, OpenID is primarily for authenticating users with an external identity provider, SAML is used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between providers, and Kerberos is typically employed for internal network authentication, not for cloud-based or federated services as described in this scenario."

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used for some log messaging but is not a solution that solves all of these problems. Most non-Windows devices, including network devices among others, are not designed to use the Windows event log format, although using NTP for time synchronization is a good idea.

The rest of the settings are problematic. For example, cookies are vulnerable to DNS spoofing. Domain cookies should usually have the narrowest possible scope, which is actually accomplished by not setting the Domain cookie. This allows only the originating server to access the cookie. Cookies without the Expires or Max-age attributes are ephemeral and will only be kept for the session, making them less vulnerable than stored cookies.

Bridging a cellular connection to a network connection to the business's network creates a path that bypasses security controls. Hotspots could be used as rogue access points, but this is a less common scenario. They do not specifically allow wireless data to be intercepted and, in most modern implementations, are encrypted, thus limiting the likelihood of sniffing providing useful data."

The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes.

As these devices are increasingly embedded in buildings and infrastructure, the support model and security model are important to understand. Both the lack of separate administrative access and the lack of strong encryption can be addressed by placing the IoT devices on a dedicated subnet or network that prevents other users from accessing the devices directly.

Dual power supplies allow multiple levels of availability support; they allow you to connect servers to distinct power infrastructures and also provide the ability to run if a single power supply dies. Some servers are even set up to use more than two power supplies. Another approach to this type of availability is to use more systems, rather than more expensive systems with greater support for availability."

Each team member reviews the checklist on their own. Tabletop exercises are slightly more impactful because they require bringing together the DR team in the same room. Parallel tests require the activation of alternate processing sites and require significant resources. Full interruption tests are the most impactful type of exercise because they involve shifting operations to the alternate site and could disrupt production activity."

    "explanation": "During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems."

Pass-the-hash attacks are not typically conducted by downloading hashes from third-party sites. 125. The protocols match with the descriptions as follows: 1. TCP: C. Transports data over a network in a connection-oriented fashion 2. UDP: D. Transports data over a network in a connectionless fashion 3. DNS: B. Performs translations between FQDNs and IP addresses 4. ARP: A. Performs translations between MAC addresses and IP addresses The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) into IP addresses, making it possible to easily remember websites and hostnames. ARP is used to resolve IP addresses into MAC addresses. TCP and UDP are used to control the network traffic that travels between systems. TCP does so in a connection-oriented fashion using the three-way handshake, while UDP uses connectionless “best-effort” delivery.

    "explanation": "Detective access controls operate after the fact and are intended to detect or discover unwanted access or activity. Preventive access controls are designed to prevent the activity from occurring, whereas corrective controls return an environment to its original status after an issue occurs. Directive access controls limit or direct the actions of subjects to ensure compliance with policies."

    "explanation": "A honeypot is a decoy computer system used to bait intruders into attacking. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots that creates a more sophisticated environment for intruders to explore. A pseudo-flaw is a false vulnerability in a system that may distract an attacker. Administrators often include pseudo-flaws on honeypots to emulate well-known operating system vulnerabilities. A darknet is a segment of unused network address space that should have no network activity and, therefore, may be easily used to monitor for illicit activity."

    "explanation": "At point B, the false acceptance rate (FAR) is quite high, whereas the false rejection rate (FRR) is relatively low. This may be acceptable in some circumstances, but in organizations where a false acceptance can cause a major problem, it is likely that they should instead choose a point to the right of point A."
